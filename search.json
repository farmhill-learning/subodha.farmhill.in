He has been practicing this for six months.\nThe child has successfully used social stories to regulate himself in the past.\n\n\n\nWhat we did\n\nWe wrote a social story about the travel and put in his Avaz.\nHad a detailed discussion on how to go about the various steps and waiting at the airport.\n\nHere is the schedule.\n\n\n\nWhat the parent did\n\nHis mother made a written schedule detailing the entire trip.\nHis mother carried the materials required for him to work while waiting.\nHe had a schedule for sequence of things to do along with a timer.\n\nGuess what happened…the family travelled without any issues!!\nHere is a video of the child engaging himself with stitching while in the airplane. Notice the timer!\n\nThis makes us so proud. Such a clear example of how preparation, scheduling and social stories work. When we talk about building indepence in children, this is the direction.\nPlease note that these interventions are shared for general guidance. Designing and executing interventions - more importantly - noticing how the child responds and modifying the interventions so the child does not get distressed, is a specialist job.

    "text": "FTP\nThe Family Training Programme (FTP) at Subodha is a cornerstone initiative designed to build a strong, functional relationship between children and their parents. It focuses on creating an environment of mutual understanding and cooperation, where both parents and children learn to listen to and understand each other.\nKey aspects and objectives of the FTP include:\n\nBuilding Working Relationships: The programme emphasises creating a space where parents and children listen to each other, which fosters understanding and emotional regulation. This involves moving beyond simple instruction-following to a deeper connection.\nEmpowering Parents: The FTP equips parents with the skills and knowledge to independently support their children’s development across various areas. Parents learn to become independent of therapists, gaining the confidence to implement home schooling programmes effectively.\nCommunication: Communication is a foundational element, teaching parents how to facilitate their child’s ability to express wants, needs, and feelings.\nGoal-Oriented Learning: Parents learn to plan and execute goals tailored to their child’s specific needs.\nGroup Cohesion: A key highlight is preparing parents to work with other children, enabling them to support each other and create opportunities for breaks and shared responsibilities. This cohesiveness helps in building a community where parents are equipped and happy to work with other parents and children.\nCommunity Building: The FTP lays the foundation for relationships and friendships among parents, creating a supportive network where they can share experiences and support one another.\nEmotional Regulation: A key focus of the FTP is helping children understand and regulate their emotions, as well as providing parents with the emotional support they need.\nDuration and Options: The programme typically involves the parent and child attending the centre together for about three months. Following this, parents can choose to continue in a classroom setting at Subodha, opt for a homeschool setup, or receive curriculum support to homeschool independently.\n\nThe FTP is designed to create a supportive and inclusive community where neurodiverse individuals and their families can thrive."

    "text": "Homeschooling Support\nHomeschooling support at Subodha is a flexible programme that builds on the foundation of the Family Training Programme (FTP). After completing the FTP, parents have several options for continuing their child’s education.\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of the homeschooling support provided:\n\nContinuation after FTP: After the three-month FTP, parents can choose to continue with a homeschooling setup.\nLocation: This can either be at Subodha in one of our three homeschooling classrooms or independently at home.\nHome Programme:\n\nCurriculum Support: Parents can take a curriculum from Subodha, with support for literacy, numeracy, EVS (Environmental Studies), and emotional regulation goals. The curriculum is responsive and eve evolving, along with the needs of the child.\nReview and Collaboration: Parents can review goals with the Subodha team weekly or monthly, depending on their needs.\n\nClassroom Structure:\n\nMaximum of five children in a classroom.\nChildren are not expected to behave like in a traditional school classroom, but should be able to return to tasks when requested.\nIf children need extra support, parents or shadows (classroom support staff) can assist.\n\nShadow Support: If a parent cannot attend, a shadow can be provided to help the child with regulation, breaks, and interventions.\nCross-Training: Parents, therapists, and shadows exchange children to provide varied support.\nCommunity Support: Parents pitch in for each other, sharing skills and providing respite. For example, one parent helped a child with running away behaviour by teaching him safety rules.\nTherapist Involvement: Therapists create learning materials and provide care during parent meetings.\nInteractive Learning: Discussions are interactive, with therapists using open-ended questions and adapting to yes/no questions with visuals for clarity.\nCurriculum Mapping: The homeschooling programme is mapped against NIOS (National Institute of Open Schooling) goals, tracking elementary-level progress in maths and EVS.\nFocus on Social Skills: The programme recognises the importance of social interaction for cognitive development.\nNIOS Options: Subodha supports students up to grade 10 and can accommodate non-math and science subjects like baking, painting, and home science, depending on the child’s aptitude. The source notes that students can directly apply for grade 10.\n\n\nClasses offered in homeschool program\nThe homeschooling programme at Subodha incorporates a variety of classes and activities to support the holistic development of the children. These include:\n\nEnglish Classes: These classes focus on improving children’s vocabulary, comprehension, and communication skills, as well as reading, writing, and typing skills. The curriculum uses books and activities tailored to the children’s skill levels and communication modes.\nMath Classes: The math curriculum includes topics under numerical literacy that are relevant to the daily lives of the children, such as understanding money and time. The curriculum is customised based on the children’s interests.\nCooking Classes: These classes aim to teach the children to eventually become self-sufficient. They learn a variety of things such as going to the market and buying groceries, peeling and chopping the vegetables, washing vegetables, washing the utensils, and maintaining kitchen rules and hygiene.\nEVS/Science: The curriculum offers support for EVS (Environmental Studies) goals. For older students, support is provided for NIOS (National Institute of Open Schooling).\nLeisure Activities: Subodha offers daily leisure classes to promote pre-vocational skills and community interaction. These activities also provide opportunities for **experimentation and creativity.\n\n\nEnglish classes\nEnglish classes at Subodha focus on enhancing children’s vocabulary, comprehension, and communication skills, as well as their reading, writing, and typing abilities. The curriculum is designed to be engaging and relevant, with careful consideration given to each child’s skill level and communication style.\nHere are some key aspects of the English classes:\n\nCurriculum Planning: The teacher selects books covering relevant topics and explores these topics in depth through various activities and worksheets.\nAdaptability: Activities are adapted based on the children’s communication modes. For children who are non-verbal, questions can be converted to yes/no formats or presented visually.\nLanguage Skills: The classes work on grammar and language building skills to improve communication.\nRelevant Topics: Topics covered include personal information, transport, road safety, and seasons. Lessons are also planned based on the immediate needs of the children, such as addressing inappropriate behaviours and teaching about boundaries, private and public spaces, and sexual education. These lessons help introduce rules and appropriate behaviours in different environments.\nReal-Life Application: Lessons are planned to have real-life applications such as taste, utensils lessons.\nEmotional Nuance: Vocabulary development extends to concepts like laziness and boredom.\n\n\n\nMath classes\nMath classes at Subodha focus on numerical literacy and its relevance to the children’s daily lives. The curriculum is designed to be engaging and adaptable, catering to the individual needs and interests of the children.\nHere are some key aspects of the maths classes:\n\nCurriculum Topics: Topics include knowing about the calendar, numbers, digits, quantities, and money skills (such as identifying currency and understanding transactions). Algebra and geometry are considered to have less significance in the lives of the children compared to topics like understanding time.\nReal-Life Relevance: The focus is on making maths meaningful by relating it to the children’s experiences. For example, understanding how long they have to wait for a snack or a visit to their grandma’s place.\nCustomisation: Learning materials are customised according to the children’s preferences and areas of interest.\nEngagement: Fun activities are used to connect academic learning to real life. For example, role-playing games, such as “maintaining shop”, are used to teach maths skills.\nRole-Playing Games: In the “maintaining shop” activity, children act as customers and teachers act as shopkeepers. The children choose items from a menu, calculate the amount, pay, and collect change, which reinforces addition, multiplication, and money skills. This activity also teaches important social skills and protocols.\nIndividualised Approach: The curriculum is individualised to suit the child, for instance, using a child’s love for food to teach multiplication.\n\n\n\nCooking classes\nCooking classes at Subodha are designed to teach children to eventually become self-sufficient. The classes involve a variety of activities that build practical skills and reinforce important rules and hygiene practices.\nHere’s a detailed look at what the cooking classes entail:\n\nSkills Taught:\n\nGoing to the market and buying groceries\nPeeling and chopping vegetables\nWashing vegetables and utensils\nUsing a variety of utensils and devices\n\nHygiene and Rules:\n\nMaintaining kitchen rules and hygiene\nAddressing behaviours like putting things in their mouth by reminding and redirecting the children to follow rules and maintain hygiene\nWashing hands as needed, sometimes up to 5-10 times in one class\n\nCustomised Lessons:\n\nRecipes are planned based on the children’s skill levels\n\nReal-Life Application:\n\nOften, children make their own snacks and eat - and that’s a very motivating real life application!"

    "text": "Family Training Program (FTP)\nA 3 month program offered to every family that wishes to join Subodha Community. Groups of 5 to 7 parents and their children work with a team of therapists, for half a day everyday. The objective of the program is for all of us to look at the working relationship between the parents and the child, and also try learn how to improving it. FTP has been very enriching for the parents as well as the therapists and has usually resulted in significant improvement in the quality of life for the family. The three month period of the FTP also helps the parents get to know about the community and comfortably make a decision to continue to work together.\n\n\nHomeschool Support\nThis program is aimed at parents who feel the need to continue to work with their children, instead of outsourcing their education and training to schools or therapy centers. Upto 5 parents come together to form a homeschool group. Senior resources at the center provide help and guidance in crafting Individual Educaitonal Program for each child. The parents take the role of teachers to work with their children. Each homeschool group is supported by therapists in their day to day work. Homeschool groups stay at the center from 10am to 4pm and usually work with a timetable, planned activities etc., just like a school.\n\n\nAfterschool Support\nNeurodiverse children who attend schools usually tend to need specific help in academics as well as social skills. After-school support is aimed at providing such support. The sessions are conducted in the evening for about 1.5 hours, from Monday to Friday.\n\n\nIntensive Support\nSome learners continue to need intensive, one-to-one support in various areas like academic skills, activities of daily living and social skills. Subodha offers half day intensive programs where the learner stays at the center from 10am to 1pm, supported by a full time resource.\n\nNeed support?\nWrite to us!\nContact Us"

    "text": "At Subodha, we work with teenagers too. Many children have limited communication skills and those skills do not help them when they are agitated. We come across many situations where the child is upset about something and lack of communication pushes the teenager into a meltdown.\nWhen we are trying to co-regulate, first we validate their emotions. We say ‘I see you are upset about something’. To facilitate communication, we rely on yes/no questions. And then we extend it to a dialogue.\nThe following conversation happened between a teacher and a teenager.\nThe teenager, let us say G, is a calm and quiet person. But when he gets agitated, he finds it difficult to manage and starts biting his hand. He screams for a long time to let the emotion pass. But he keeps remembering the incident and feels bad for a very long time. G communicates using Avaz AAC.\nSetting: Classroom where there are 5 children and three adults. Context: G puts his hands inside pants. Teacher reminds him to keep hands on the table. G: Starts screaming and crying.\nThe entire class follows the routine of going to the calming room with an adult as part of ‘Group rules’. They go to the calming area. He takes a pause while crying.\nT: Are you ready to get up? G: No T: Are you ready to talk? G: No T: Okay! I will wait.\nG takes his hands to bite and two adults block him. He starts screaming and crying again.\nT: How are you feeling? G: Angry!\nT : Your teacher asked you to take your hands out. Did that make you angry? G : Yes T: Okay ! I hear you and understand that you are angry, but you cannot bite yourself\nT : Are you ready to keep good hands? G: No.\nT: Then I am going to hold. I don’t want you to hurt your hands. G: Wails loudly.\nAfter about 2 mins,\nT: Is it okay to put hands in pants, in public? (Their class learnt ‘Public and Private’ in their EVS class) G: No T: That is why your teacher reminded you of it.\nT: How are you feeling now? G: Okay\nT: Can I leave your hands? Will you keep good hands? G: Yes\nT: Do you want a break? G: Yes\nT: What do you want in the break? G: Chips\nT: You cannot have chips in the calming room. We need to go to class for that. G: Gets up and walks to the classroom.\nBy that time, it was lunch time. He finished lunch and ate chips.\nThis time, he did not remember the incident after that."
