    "text": "At Subodha, we support families with older children on the spectrum.\nRecently, one of our students had to travel by air and the parent was concerned about whether the child will understand the various steps and co-operate during waiting. We took it upon ourselves to facilitate air travel.\n\nWhat we had\n\nThe child can do some activities independently, which the mother has been facilitating at our center.\nThe child is used to following a visual schedule with a timer. He has been practicing this for six months.\nThe child has successfully used social stories to regulate himself in the past.\n\n\n\nWhat we did\n\nWe wrote a social story about the travel and put in his Avaz.\nHad a detailed discussion on how to go about the various steps and waiting at the airport.\n\nHere is the schedule.\n\n\n\nWhat the parent did\n\nHis mother made a written schedule detailing the entire trip.\nHis mother carried the materials required for him to work while waiting.\nHe had a schedule for sequence of things to do along with a timer.\n\nGuess what happened…the family travelled without any issues!!\nHere is a video of the child engaging himself with stitching while in the airplane. Notice the timer!\n\nThis makes us so proud. Such a clear example of how preparation, scheduling and social stories work. When we talk about building indepence in children, this is the direction.\nPlease note that these interventions are shared for general guidance. Designing and executing interventions - more importantly - noticing how the child responds and modifying the interventions so the child does not get distressed, is a specialist job. Consult qualified therapists as necessary.\n\nNeed support for your child?\nGet in touch for expert help!\nContact Us"

    "text": "How does the curriculum cater to children’s interests?\nSubodha’s curriculum caters to children’s interests through customisation of learning materials according to their preferences and areas of interest. Here are some examples of how the curriculum is adapted:\n\nIn math, when a child showed no interest in learning about multiplication word problems, the teacher presented the problem so that the child was cast as a customer buying food items, which successfully engaged her.\nEnglish classes use carefully selected books and activities designed to be engaging, also taking into account the children’s skill level and communication mode.\nThe curriculum incorporates topics relevant to the children’s real lives and current needs, such as transport, road safety, and seasons. Additionally, it addresses immediate needs and inappropriate behaviours as they arise, like teaching about boundaries, private and public spaces, and sexual education.\nCooking classes plan recipes based on the children’s varying skill levels.\nLeisure activities are designed to develop pre-vocational skills, while also allowing for experimentation and creativity, often aligning with upcoming celebrations.\nThe math curriculum prioritises topics under numerical literacy that are relevant to the daily lives of the children. For instance, learning about time helps children understand how long they have to wait for a snack or an event.\nIf children do not answer open-ended questions, therapists convert them into yes/no questions, providing visuals to aid clarity and give the child agency.\nThe after-school programme breaks down learning material into manageable parts and uses visual aids to help children understand concepts. We also use real-world examples and hands-on experiments to make the material more relatable."

    "text": "Key pedagogical approaches that define learning at Subodha\nSubodha employs several key pedagogical approaches to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment, with a strong emphasis on community engagement. These approaches include:\n\nParent Training The essence of which involves building a working relationship between the child and the parents, focusing on mutual listening and understanding to facilitate emotional regulation and independence. The training also empowers parents to support their children across all areas and prepares them to work with other children, fostering group cohesion.\nIndividualised Interventions Tailored to meet the specific needs of each child, addressing challenges such as attention deficits or emotional regulation difficulties.\nProgramme Reviews Conducted periodically with parents and the team to discuss progress, feedback, and skill alignment, ensuring that goals are matched to the children’s diverse skill sets and backgrounds.\nHolistic Perspective Programmes are viewed from cognitive, social, and emotional angles, with consideration given to the sensory needs of the child and the emotional support required by both the child and the parents.\nBehaviour Management Using non-intrusive tools to encourage positive behaviour, focusing on reinforcing appropriate actions and supporting children in self-regulation and emotional control. Strategies include written schedules with visual aids and dialogue to help children express themselves and understand boundaries.\nHomeschooling support Which offers a choice to parents after the training, to continue with classroom setups or to take curriculum support for homeschooling. The curriculum evolves and includes literacy, numeracy, and emotional regulation goals.\nCommunity Involvement Encouraging parents to actively participate in the programme, fostering a sense of community where they can support each other, exchange skills, and share experiences. This includes cross-training among parents, where they exchange children and help each other with specific challenges.\nInclusive Group Dynamics Ensuring a supportive environment for social learning, where parents are equipped to work with other children, creating a community where they can seek help and support.\nCurriculum Customisation Tailoring learning materials to match the preferences and interests of the children, making learning more engaging and relevant to their lives.\nReal-Life Application Connecting academic learning to real-life situations through activities like cooking classes, role-playing games, and practical problem-solving. These activities aim to teach children skills necessary for self-sufficiency and independence.\nAfter School support Providing academic support, social skills development, and emotional regulation techniques. This includes breaking down learning materials into manageable parts, using visual aids, and employing interactive and fun games.\nLeisure Activities Offering daily leisure classes to promote prevocational skills, encourage experimentation, and foster interaction among children and parents from different groups.\nCelebrations Celebrating various festivals to promote inclusivity and create a sense of community.

    "text": "Emotional Regulation\nEmotional regulation is a key focus area at Subodha, integrated into various programmes and activities. Here’s how emotional regulation is addressed:\n\nFamily Training Programme (FTP): The FTP focuses on building a working relationship between parents and children. This involves creating a space where they listen to each other, fostering understanding and emotional regulation. A key focus of the FTP is helping children understand and regulate their emotions, as well as providing parents with the emotional support they need.\nProgramme Reviews: Programme reviews consider the emotional support that both the child and the parent need.\nHomeschooling Programme: Emotional regulation goals are supported within the homeschooling curriculum.\nBehaviour Management: Subodha uses non-intrusive tools to encourage positive behaviour and focuses on reinforcing appropriate behaviours. Strategies are implemented to support children in self-regulation and emotional control, especially when dealing with meltdowns and temper tantrums. The source also mentions the use of written schedules with visual aids to enhance predictability.\nCalming Area: Subodha provides a safe and structured calming area for self-regulation.\nAfter-School Programme: One of the three pillars of the after-school programme is emotional regulation. This involves helping children acknowledge their feelings and learn effective coping strategies. For example, children are taught breathing techniques to manage anxiety during exams.\nEnglish Classes: Lessons are planned to address immediate needs as they arise, including appropriate behaviours and boundaries.\nCommunication and Dialogue: Dialogue is emphasised as necessary, giving children the space to express and communicate their feelings. Asking the right kinds of questions is important.\nSocial Stories: Social stories and consistent interventions are used to address specific behaviours, such as running away.\nCommunity Support: The community environment at Subodha allows parents to support each other. For example, parents share experiences and provide respite, which contributes to overall emotional well-being.\n\nEmotional regulation is interwoven into Subodha’s various programmes, creating a supportive environment that addresses both the child’s and the family’s emotional needs."

    "text": "At Subodha, we work with teenagers too. Many children have limited communication skills and those skills do not help them when they are agitated. We come across many situations where the child is upset about something and lack of communication pushes the teenager into a meltdown.\nWhen we are trying to co-regulate, first we validate their emotions. We say ‘I see you are upset about something’. To facilitate communication, we rely on yes/no questions. And then we extend it to a dialogue.\nThe following conversation happened between a teacher and a teenager.\nThe teenager, let us say G, is a calm and quiet person. But when he gets agitated, he finds it difficult to manage and starts biting his hand. He screams for a long time to let the emotion pass. But he keeps remembering the incident and feels bad for a very long time. G communicates using Avaz AAC.\nSetting: Classroom where there are 5 children and three adults. Context: G puts his hands inside pants. Teacher reminds him to keep hands on the table. G: Starts screaming and crying.\nThe entire class follows the routine of going to the calming room with an adult as part of ‘Group rules’. They go to the calming area. He takes a pause while crying.\nT: Are you ready to get up? G: No T: Are you ready to talk? G: No T: Okay! I will wait.\nG takes his hands to bite and two adults block him. He starts screaming and crying again.\nT: How are you feeling? G: Angry!\nT : Your teacher asked you to take your hands out. Did that make you angry? G : Yes T: Okay ! I hear you and understand that you are angry, but you cannot bite yourself\nT : Are you ready to keep good hands? G: No.\nT: Then I am going to hold. I don’t want you to hurt your hands.
