    "text": "Family Training Program (FTP)\nA 3 month program offered to every family that wishes to join Subodha Community. Groups of 5 to 7 parents and their children work with a team of therapists, for half a day everyday. The objective of the program is for all of us to look at the working relationship between the parents and the child, and also try learn how to improving it. FTP has been very enriching for the parents as well as the therapists and has usually resulted in significant improvement in the quality of life for the family. The three month period of the FTP also helps the parents get to know about the community and comfortably make a decision to continue to work together.\n\n\nHomeschool Support\nThis program is aimed at parents who feel the need to continue to work with their children, instead of outsourcing their education and training to schools or therapy centers. Upto 5 parents come together to form a homeschool group. Senior resources at the center provide help and guidance in crafting Individual Educaitonal Program for each child. The parents take the role of teachers to work with their children. Each homeschool group is supported by therapists in their day to day work. Homeschool groups stay at the center from 10am to 4pm and usually work with a timetable, planned activities etc., just like a school.\n\n\nAfterschool Support\nNeurodiverse children who attend schools usually tend to need specific help in academics as well as social skills. After-school support is aimed at providing such support. The sessions are conducted in the evening for about 1.5 hours, from Monday to Friday.\n\n\nIntensive Support\nSome learners continue to need intensive, one-to-one support in various areas like academic skills, activities of daily living and social skills. Subodha offers half day intensive programs where the learner stays at the center from 10am to 1pm, supported by a full time resource.\n\nNeed support?\nWrite to us!\nContact Us"

    "text": "At Subodha, we work with teenagers too. Many children have limited communication skills and those skills do not help them when they are agitated. We come across many situations where the child is upset about something and lack of communication pushes the teenager into a meltdown.\nWhen we are trying to co-regulate, first we validate their emotions. We say ‘I see you are upset about something’. To facilitate communication, we rely on yes/no questions. And then we extend it to a dialogue.\nThe following conversation happened between a teacher and a teenager.\nThe teenager, let us say G, is a calm and quiet person. But when he gets agitated, he finds it difficult to manage and starts biting his hand. He screams for a long time to let the emotion pass. But he keeps remembering the incident and feels bad for a very long time. G communicates using Avaz AAC.\nSetting: Classroom where there are 5 children and three adults. Context: G puts his hands inside pants. Teacher reminds him to keep hands on the table. G: Starts screaming and crying.\nThe entire class follows the routine of going to the calming room with an adult as part of ‘Group rules’. They go to the calming area. He takes a pause while crying.\nT: Are you ready to get up? G: No T: Are you ready to talk? G: No T: Okay! I will wait.\nG takes his hands to bite and two adults block him. He starts screaming and crying again.\nT: How are you feeling? G: Angry!\nT : Your teacher asked you to take your hands out. Did that make you angry? G : Yes T: Okay ! I hear you and understand that you are angry, but you cannot bite yourself\nT : Are you ready to keep good hands? G: No.\nT: Then I am going to hold. I don’t want you to hurt your hands. G: Wails loudly.\nAfter about 2 mins,\nT: Is it okay to put hands in pants, in public? (Their class learnt ‘Public and Private’ in their EVS class) G: No T: That is why your teacher reminded you of it.\nT: How are you feeling now? G: Okay\nT: Can I leave your hands? Will you keep good hands? G: Yes\nT: Do you want a break? G: Yes\nT: What do you want in the break? G: Chips\nT: You cannot have chips in the calming room. We need to go to class for that. G: Gets up and walks to the classroom.\nBy that time, it was lunch time. He finished lunch and ate chips.\nThis time, he did not remember the incident after that."

    "text": "At Subodha, we support families with older children on the spectrum.\nRecently, one of our students had to travel by air and the parent was concerned about whether the child will understand the various steps and co-operate during waiting. We took it upon ourselves to facilitate air travel.\n\nWhat we had\n\nThe child can do some activities independently, which the mother has been facilitating at our center.\nThe child is used to following a visual schedule with a timer. He has been practicing this for six months.\nThe child has successfully used social stories to regulate himself in the past.\n\n\n\nWhat we did\n\nWe wrote a social story about the travel and put in his Avaz.\nHad a detailed discussion on how to go about the various steps and waiting at the airport.\n\nHere is the schedule.\n\n\n\nWhat the parent did\n\nHis mother made a written schedule detailing the entire trip.\nHis mother carried the materials required for him to work while waiting.\nHe had a schedule for sequence of things to do along with a timer.\n\nGuess what happened…the family travelled without any issues!!\nHere is a video of the child engaging himself with stitching while in the airplane. Notice the timer!\n\nThis makes us so proud. Such a clear example of how preparation, scheduling and social stories work. When we talk about building indepence in children, this is the direction.\nPlease note that these interventions are shared for general guidance. Designing and executing interventions - more importantly - noticing how the child responds and modifying the interventions so the child does not get distressed, is a specialist job. Consult qualified therapists as necessary.\n\nNeed support for your child?\nGet in touch for expert help!\nContact Us"
