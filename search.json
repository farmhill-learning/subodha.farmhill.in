    "text": "Family Training Program (FTP)\nThis is a 3 month program that is offered to every family that wishes to join Subodha Community. During this program, groups of 5 to 7 parents and their children work with a team of therapists, for half a day everyday.\nThe objective of the program is for all of us to look at the working relationship between the parents and the child, and also try learn how to improving it.\nIn our experience, FTP has been very enriching for the parents as well as the therapists and has usually resulted in significant improvement in the quality of life for the family.\nThe three month period of the FTP also helps the parents get to know about the community and comfortably make a decision to continue to work together."

Senior resources at the center provide help and guidance in crafting Individual Educaitonal Program for each child. The parents take the role of teachers to work with their children. Each homeschool group is supported by therapists in their day to day work.\nHomeschool groups stay at the center from 10am to 4pm and usually work with a timetable, planned activities etc., just like a school."
