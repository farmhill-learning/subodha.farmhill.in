Senior resources at the center \nprovide help and guidance in crafting Individual Educaitonal Program for each child. \nThe parents take the role of teachers to work with their children. \nEach homeschool group is supported by therapists in their day to day work. \nHomeschool groups stay at the center from 10am to 4pm and usually work with a timetable, \nplanned activities etc., just like a school. \n\n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                Afterschool Support\n                Neurodiverse children who attend schools usually tend to need specific help \nin academics as well as social skills.
