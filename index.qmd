## Our Approach

# Programs 

At Subodha, we focus on supporting families living with neurodiversity. We usually work with families whose children are 10 to 18 years old. 

## Family Training Program (FTP)

This is a 3 month program that is offered to every family that wishes to join Subodha Community. During this program, groups of 5 to 7 parents and their children work with a team of therapists, for half a day everyday. 

The objective of the program is for all of us to look at the working relationship between the parents and the child, and also try learn how to improving it. 

In our experience, FTP has been very enriching for the parents as well as the therapists and has usually resulted in significant improvement in the quality of life for the family. 

The three month period of the FTP also helps the parents get to know about the community and comfortably make a decision to continue to work together. 

## Homeschool Support

This program is aimed at parents who feel the need to continue to work with their children, instead of outsourcing their education and training to schools or therapy centers. 

Upto 5 parents come together to form a homeschool group. Senior resources at the center provide help and guidance in crafting Individual Educaitonal Program for each child. The parents take the role of teachers to work with their children. Each homeschool group is supported by therapists in their day to day work.

Homeschool groups stay at the center from 10am to 4pm and usually work with a timetable, planned activities etc., just like a school. 

## After-school Support

Neurodiverse children who attend schools usually tend to need specific help in academics as well as social skills. After-school support is aimed at providing such support. 

The sessions are conducted in the evening for about 1.5 hours, from Monday to Friday. 

## Intensive Support

Some learners continue to need intensive, one-to-one support in various areas like academic skills, activities of daily living and social skills. Subodha offers half day intensive programs where the learner stays at the center from 10am to 1pm, supported by a full time resource.
