## FTP

The **Family Training Programme (FTP) at Subodha** is a cornerstone initiative designed to **build a strong, functional relationship between children and their parents**. It focuses on creating an environment of mutual understanding and cooperation, where both parents and children learn to listen to and understand each other.

Key aspects and objectives of the FTP include:

- **Building Working Relationships**: The programme emphasises creating a space where parents and children listen to each other, which fosters understanding and emotional regulation. This involves moving beyond simple instruction-following to a deeper connection.
- **Empowering Parents**: The FTP equips parents with the skills and knowledge to independently support their children's development across various areas. Parents learn to become independent of therapists, gaining the confidence to implement home schooling programmes effectively.
- **Communication**: Communication is a foundational element, teaching parents how to facilitate their child's ability to express wants, needs, and feelings.
- **Goal-Oriented Learning**: Parents learn to plan and execute goals tailored to their child's specific needs.
- **Group Cohesion**: A key highlight is preparing parents to work with other children, enabling them to support each other and create opportunities for breaks and shared responsibilities. This cohesiveness helps in building a community where parents are equipped and happy to work with other parents and children.
- **Community Building**: The FTP lays the foundation for relationships and friendships among parents, creating a supportive network where they can share experiences and support one another.
- **Emotional Regulation**: A key focus of the FTP is helping children understand and regulate their emotions, as well as providing parents with the emotional support they need.
- **Duration and Options**: The programme typically involves the parent and child attending the centre together for about three months. Following this, parents can choose to continue in a classroom setting at Subodha, opt for a homeschool setup, or receive curriculum support to homeschool independently.

The FTP is designed to create a supportive and inclusive community where neurodiverse individuals and their families can thrive.

#### Math classes

Math classes at Subodha focus on **numerical literacy** and its relevance to the children's daily lives. The curriculum is designed to be engaging and adaptable, catering to the individual needs and interests of the children.

Here are some key aspects of the maths classes:

- **Curriculum Topics**: Topics include **knowing about the calendar, numbers, digits, quantities, and money skills** (such as identifying currency and understanding transactions). Algebra and geometry are considered to have less significance in the lives of the children compared to topics like **understanding time**.

- **Customisation**: Learning materials are customised according to the children's preferences and areas of interest.
- **Engagement**: Fun activities are used to connect academic learning to real life. For example, role-playing games, such as "maintaining shop", are used to teach maths skills.
- **Role-Playing Games**: In the "maintaining shop" activity, children act as customers and teachers act as shopkeepers. The children choose items from a menu, calculate the amount, pay, and collect change, which reinforces addition, multiplication, and money skills. This activity also teaches important social skills and protocols.
- **Individualised Approach**: The curriculum is individualised to suit the child, for instance, using a child's love for food to teach multiplication.

# Curriculum and Pedagogy

At Subodha, we are engaged in providing holistic support to neurodiverse families. Considering the unique and varied needs of this community, the curriculum and pedagogy also need to be suitable. 

## How does the curriculum cater to children's interests?

Subodha's curriculum caters to children's interests through **customisation of learning materials according to their preferences and areas of interest**. Here are some examples of how the curriculum is adapted:

- In math, when a child showed no interest in learning about multiplication word problems, the teacher presented the problem so that the child was cast as a customer buying food items, which successfully engaged her.
- English classes use carefully selected books and activities designed to be engaging, also taking into account the childrenâ€™s skill level and communication mode.
- The curriculum incorporates topics relevant to the children's real lives and current needs, such as transport, road safety, and seasons. Additionally, it addresses immediate needs and inappropriate behaviours as they arise, like teaching about boundaries, private and public spaces, and sexual education.
- Cooking classes plan recipes based on the childrenâ€™s varying skill levels.
- Leisure activities are designed to develop pre-vocational skills, while also allowing for experimentation and creativity, often aligning with upcoming celebrations.
- The math curriculum prioritises topics under numerical literacy that are relevant to the daily lives of the children. For instance, learning about time helps children understand how long they have to wait for a snack or an event.
- If children do not answer open-ended questions, therapists convert them into yes/no questions, providing visuals to aid clarity and give the child agency.
- The after-school programme breaks down learning material into manageable parts and uses visual aids to help children understand concepts. We also use real-world examples and hands-on experiments to make the material more relatable.

## Key pedagogical approaches that define learning at Subodha 

Subodha employs several key pedagogical approaches to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment, with a strong emphasis on community engagement. These approaches include:

- **Parent Training** The essence of which involves building a working relationship between the child and the parents, focusing on mutual listening and understanding to facilitate emotional regulation and independence. The training also empowers parents to support their children across all areas and prepares them to work with other children, fostering group cohesion.
- **Individualised Interventions** Tailored to meet the specific needs of each child, addressing challenges such as attention deficits or emotional regulation difficulties.
- **Programme Reviews** Conducted periodically with parents and the team to discuss progress, feedback, and skill alignment, ensuring that goals are matched to the children's diverse skill sets and backgrounds.
- **Holistic Perspective** Programmes are viewed from cognitive, social, and emotional angles, with consideration given to the sensory needs of the child and the emotional support required by both the child and the parents.
- **Behaviour Management** Using non-intrusive tools to encourage positive behaviour, focusing on reinforcing appropriate actions and supporting children in self-regulation and emotional control. Strategies include written schedules with visual aids and dialogue to help children express themselves and understand boundaries.
- **Homeschooling support** Which offers a choice to parents after the training, to continue with classroom setups or to take curriculum support for homeschooling. The curriculum evolves and includes literacy, numeracy, and emotional regulation goals.
- **Community Involvement** Encouraging parents to actively participate in the programme, fostering a sense of community where they can support each other, exchange skills, and share experiences. This includes cross-training among parents, where they exchange children and help each other with specific challenges.
- **Inclusive Group Dynamics** Ensuring a supportive environment for social learning, where parents are equipped to work with other children, creating a community where they can seek help and support.
- **Curriculum Customisation** Tailoring learning materials to match the preferences and interests of the children, making learning more engaging and relevant to their lives.
- **Real-Life Application** Connecting academic learning to real-life situations through activities like cooking classes, role-playing games, and practical problem-solving. These activities aim to teach children skills necessary for self-sufficiency and independence.
- **After School support** Providing academic support, social skills development, and emotional regulation techniques. This includes breaking down learning materials into manageable parts, using visual aids, and employing interactive and fun games.
- **Leisure Activities** Offering daily leisure classes to promote prevocational skills, encourage experimentation, and foster interaction among children and parents from different groups.
- **Celebrations** Celebrating various festivals to promote inclusivity and create a sense of community. Activities are planned to be relevant to the festival, and potluck lunches are organised.

# Success stories

Subodha has several success stories and cases that highlight the effectiveness of our programmes.

- **Home Schooling Programme**: The Family Training Programme (FTP) has successfully trained two batches of parents, empowering them to confidently implement home schooling programmes.
- **Running Away Behaviour**: In one instance, a child with a **running away behaviour** learned to stay inside and ask to go out instead of running away. This was achieved through a social story, consistent interventions, and the support of another parent who took on the responsibility of teaching the child safety behaviours, even when the child's mother was overwhelmed and scared of the child running away.
- **Picky Eating**: A child who wouldn't eat, even with their mother present, was supported by therapists who helped feed him so that he can have a good meal. This allowed the mother to focus on her younger child.
- **Emotional Regulation**: A therapist was able to use yes/no questions to understand that a child was acting out because he wanted attention.
- **Dealing with Losing**: A student in the after-school programme who had difficulty dealing with losing a game improved significantly after 6-8 months of consistent support. We acknowledged his feelings and provided him with alternate language to cope with the loss. Eventually, he was able to use the strategies he was taught to console others.
- **Maths Engagement**: A child who initially showed no interest in learning about multiplication word problems became fully engaged when the problems were presented in the context of her love for food. By customising the learning material to her interests, she was able to provide all the right answers with minimal help.
- **Eating Intervention**: A child who was not eating enough food, after two months of intervention is now eating food nicely and independently in the classroom.

# Long term goals and aspirations

Considering neurodiversity is something one is born with and needs to live with, it is important that the approaches we adapt are aligned with long term goals and aspirations of the community. Here are some of the goals we keep in mind at Subodha. 

- **Empower parents** to become confident in supporting their children's development and learning. This involves equipping parents with the skills and knowledge necessary to implement home schooling programmes effectively and independently. The Family Training Programme (FTP) is central to this goal, as it focuses on building strong working relationships between parents and children, fostering mutual understanding and emotional regulation.
   
- **Create and sustain a supportive and inclusive community** where neurodiverse individuals and their families can thrive. This includes fostering a sense of belonging, encouraging mutual support among parents, and providing a safe and understanding environment for children. The emphasis on community involvement and shared experiences, such as leisure activities and celebrations, contributes to this long-term vision.

- **Enable children to develop essential life skills and independence**, preparing them for adulthood. This encompasses a range of skills, from self-care and daily living to social interaction and emotional regulation. The curriculum is designed to be relevant to the children's lives, with a focus on functional literacy and numeracy, as well as pre-vocational skills.
   
- **Provide tailored educational support** that meets the unique needs and interests of each child. This involves customising learning materials, adapting teaching methods, and offering individualised interventions to address specific challenges. Subodha aims to support children up to grade 10, with options for non-traditional subjects that align with their aptitudes and interests.

- **Promote social skills and emotional well-being** among neurodiverse children. This includes teaching children how to manage their emotions, interact positively with others, and navigate social situations effectively. The after-school programme and leisure activities provide opportunities for children to develop these skills in a supportive and structured environment.
