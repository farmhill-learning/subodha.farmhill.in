    the parents and the child, and also try learn how to improve it.

    provide help and guidance in crafting Individual Educaitonal Program for each child.

    Neurodiverse children who attend schools usually tend to need specific help 
    in academics as well as social skills. After-school support is aimed at providing such support. 
    The sessions are conducted in the evening for about 1.5 hours, from Monday to Friday.
